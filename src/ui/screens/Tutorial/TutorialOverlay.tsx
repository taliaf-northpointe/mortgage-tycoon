Reputation (out of 100) rises with every closed loan, unlocks neighborhoods, and even makes customers trust you sooner. Active Loans counts files in motion. Happiness averages your customers\' moods. The Interest Rate drifts daily — when it dips, more buyers come shopping.',

Sarah is a first-time homebuyer with her heart set on a Cozy Bungalow in Old Town, applying for an FHA loan — a program first-timers favor because it permits a smaller down payment. Every customer shows two feelings: Happiness (how the process feels) and Trust (how much they believe in you). Both genuinely change how they behave.",

Application: the official paperwork, answered by a Loan Estimate. These first steps are conversations — when YOU work them, a click of Continue moves the loan along instantly, all the way to Document Collection. A hired Loan Officer walks the same road automatically, on the office clock.',

Underwriting: the decisive review — every single document needs a sign-off, and the decision takes the better part of a day. Clear to Close, then Closing: the signing table. Complete: the loan funds and keys change hands. Solo, YOU do each part; each hire automates theirs.",

Trusting customers respond faster; happy customers send correct papers; a stressed or forgetful one occasionally sends the wrong thing and has to redo it.",

Continue Processing: advance the loan — instant through the early conversations, then gated by real requirements and working time from Processing onward. Contact: a friendly check-in worth +2 happiness and growing trust — the stronger your reputation, the more your word counts — at the cost of one hour's work on the file. Delay: shelve a loan and Resume it later.",

Their pace is never fixed: skill, happiness, and level all speed them up, and workload past 75% slows them down and grinds their morale. You can also let people go to cut payroll, but everyone who stays takes it hard.',

Solo you keep every dollar; hires cost payroll daily but multiply your throughput. Reinvest through the Upgrades tree: training, technology, marketing, customer experience, and office comforts.",

    body: "From day 6 onward, an occasional morning brings a mishap: the Wi-Fi drops, the printer jams, a surprise system update halves everyone's speed, or the coffee machine breaks. Without IT on staff, an outsourced tech takes their time. At level 5 you can hire your own IT Support — outages become half as frequent, get fixed sooner, and sting morale less.",

Mastery invites adversity — from level 10 underwriting can bounce a loan back, from level 20 a neglected customer will walk away, and the level-20 audit goes far better with Compliance (unlocks at 15) on staff.
