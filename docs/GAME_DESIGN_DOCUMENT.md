# Mortgage Empire — Game Design Document

**Version:** 1.0 · July 2026
**Status:** Design locked to Pencil mockup set v1 (`mortgage_game_design.pen`, 10 screens)
**Purpose:** This is the source of truth for all gameplay, content, and UI decisions. Every implementation session (human or AI) should reference this document. If code and this document disagree, this document wins — or this document gets updated first.

## 1. Game Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Title** | Mortgage Empire |
| **Tagline** | *Build your neighborhood. Own the block.* |
| **Genre** | Cozy 2D isometric management / tycoon |
| **Positioning pill** | "A Cozy Tycoon Game" |
| **Target audience** | Casual players 16+; no mortgage knowledge required |
| **Platform** | Browser (desktop-first, 1440×900 design canvas) |
| **Session length** | 10–30 minutes (one to a few in-game days) |
| **Educational goal** | A player who finishes the tutorial and a few days of play should be able to describe the home-loan journey in plain language, without ever reading jargon |

**Elevator pitch:** Mortgage Empire is a cozy management game where you guide real, memorable people — not loan numbers — through the journey of buying a home. You grow from a single desk into a regional mortgage company by keeping customers happy, your team healthy, and your pipeline flowing.

**Win condition:** There is no final boss. The long-term goal is transforming one desk in Old Town into a thriving multi-branch company across the Meadowbrook Region, with high reputation and happy customers. Progression milestones (Section 10) provide the sense of "winning."

**Lose condition:** Soft-fail only. Running out of money pauses hiring/upgrades and forces recovery play; it never hard-ends a save. Customers can walk away (lost loan, reputation hit), but the game never game-overs.

**Design pillars:**
1. **People, not paperwork.** Every loan is a character with a face, traits, and a dream home.
2. **Plain language everywhere.** "Papers" not "documentation," "Yes/No" not "underwriting decision." (Codified in the Style Guide voice rules — Section 12.)
3. **Cozy, never punishing.** Setbacks create gentle pressure and choices, not failure screens.
4. **Simplified but truthful.** The 7-stage loan journey mirrors the real process closely enough to be genuinely educational.

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

```
Customer arrives (lead)
      ↓
Take application
      ↓
Collect documents ("papers")
      ↓
Review the file
      ↓
Approval decision ("Yes/No")
      ↓
Closing (signing)
      ↓
Completed — customer gets the keys 🎉
      ↓
Earn revenue → upgrade office / hire & train staff / expand to new neighborhoods
      ↓
More (and bigger) customers arrive
```

**Moment-to-moment play:** The player watches the office scene and notification feed, opens the Pipeline to advance loans, opens Customer profiles to resolve blockers (missing papers, unhappy customers), and manages Employees when workload tags appear. The day ends with an End-of-Day Summary, then the player starts the next day.

**Time model:** Day-based with seasons. The HUD displays e.g. `DAY 42 · SPRING · MONDAY`. Each day simulates a working timeline of 9 AM–6 PM (this drives the hourly revenue chart on the End-of-Day screen). Loans track "days in pipeline."

---

## 3. Loan Stages (The Pipeline)

Seven stages, presented as a Kanban board. Stage names and the fixed progress % each stage represents (as designed in the Pipeline mockup):

| # | Stage | Progress | Friendly journey label (Customer screen) | What happens |
|---|-------|----------|------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Lead | 15% | "Hello!" | Customer is interested; a Loan Officer must engage them |
| 2 | Application | 30% | "Filling forms" | Basic info collected |
| 3 | Documents | 45% | "Papers" | Required documents gathered; most blockers live here |
| 4 | Review | 60% | "Checking" | A Reviewer checks the file |
| 5 | Approval | 75% | "Yes/No" | The decision is made |
| 6 | Closing | 90% | "Signing" | Paperwork signed with a Closer |
| 7 | Completed | 100% | "Home!" | Keys handed over; revenue earned; celebration moment |

**Loan card data (Pipeline board):** avatar/initials, customer name, loan type, loan amount (e.g. `$340K`), days in pipeline, progress %, and optional status tag.

**Status tags seen in mockups (initial tag vocabulary):** `Missing 2 docs`, `Rate lock`, `Ready`, `Sign 8/12`, `Closed`.

**Loan types (4 at launch):**
- **First Home** — smaller amounts ($195K–$240K range in mockups); pairs with first-time-buyer characters who need more guidance but give big happiness payoffs.
- **Home Purchase** — the standard type ($275K–$355K range).
- **Refinance** — existing homeowners ($210K–$470K); typically faster, fewer documents.
- **Investment** — largest amounts ($525K–$685K); impatient customers, higher revenue, higher walk-away risk.

**Pipeline summary metrics (top of Pipeline screen):** Total Loans, Total Volume ($), Avg. Time in Pipeline (days), Conversion Rate (%) — each with a delta vs. prior period.

**Loan detail popover (click a card):** customer name, loan ID (`LN-YYYY-NNNN` format), type, stage chip (`IN DOCUMENTS · DAY 6`), amount / term / rate, document checklist with per-item `Request` buttons, and actions **Move to [next stage]** and **Contact**.

---

## 4. Customers

Customers are the emotional core. Every customer has:

- **Identity:** name, portrait, age, buyer type label (e.g. "First-time Homebuyer · Age 32")
- **Personality traits:** 2–3 chips (e.g. `Enthusiastic`, `Detail-oriented`, `Prompt`). Traits modify behavior: response speed to document requests, patience (walk-away threshold), happiness sensitivity.
- **Happiness:** 0–100%, shown with a smile meter. Rises with speed, communication, and successful stages; falls with delays and repeated requests. Weekly trend shown (e.g. "↑ 8 this week").
- **Trust Level:** 1–5 bars, a slower-moving stat built through good service; high trust makes customers forgiving of hiccups and generates referrals.
- **Dream Home card:** home name + style ("Cozy Bungalow"), neighborhood, beds/baths, a category chip ("Family Home"), Home Price, Down Payment, and estimated Monthly payment. This is where the game quietly teaches price → down payment → monthly payment relationships.
- **Journey tracker:** the 7 friendly-labeled stages with the current position and an encouraging status line ("You're doing great! Waiting on 2 more documents to move ahead.").
- **Document checklist** with plain-language names (real-world equivalent in parentheses for the design team only — players never see jargon):

| In-game name | Sub-label | Real-world equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Proof of Job | Recent paychecks | Pay stubs / employment verification |
| Money in the Bank | Savings statements | Bank/asset statements |
| Photo ID | Driver license | Identity verification |
| Home Address History | Where she has lived | Residence history |
| References | People who vouch for her | References / VOR |
| Tax Papers | From last year | Tax returns / W-2s |
| Home Inspection | Report from inspector | Inspection/appraisal |

Not every loan requires every document — Refinance skips some; Investment adds extras. Checklist shows "5 of 7 collected · 2 more to go!" style progress with an encouragement chip ("Almost there!").

**Player actions on a customer (4 buttons, fixed):**
1. **Request Documents** — ask for missing papers (small happiness cost if repeated)
2. **Continue Processing** — move to next stage (only when requirements met)
3. **Contact Customer** — send a friendly message (+happiness, +trust, small time cost)
4. **Delay** — set aside for later (happiness decays while delayed)

**Character archetype seeds (initial cast concepts):** Enthusiastic first-timer (Sarah Chen pattern), impatient investor (Ivan Petrov / Ravi Sethi pattern), retiree who needs guidance, growing family (The Martinez / Johnson Family pattern). Content goal at launch: ~12 named archetypes with trait combinations, drawn randomly with procedural names thereafter.

---

## 5. Employees

**Roles (4 hireable at launch), mapped to pipeline stages:**

| Role | Owns stages | Mockup salary range |
|---|---|---|
| Loan Officer | Lead, Application | $4,400–$5,800/mo |
| Processor | Documents | $3,600–$4,100/mo |
| Reviewer | Review, Approval | $4,700–$5,400/mo |
| Closer | Closing, Completed | $4,200–$5,100/mo |

**Employee stats:** Skill (1–5 stars), Happiness (0–100%), Workload (0–100%), Monthly salary, loans in progress.

**Status tags (auto-applied by the simulation):**
- `Star Employee` — top skill + high happiness; small aura buff to nearby workers
- `Ready to Promote` — skill capped for current level; promote to unlock
- `Overworked` — workload ≥ ~90%; skill effectiveness drops
- `Needs a break` — sustained high workload + low happiness; risk of quitting if ignored

**Per-employee actions:** Train (spend money → skill XP), Promote (raise + skill cap increase), Assign Work (rebalance loans).
**Team-level actions:** Hire (new candidates with randomized skill/salary), plus team tabs filtered by role.
**Team header metrics:** headcount, average happiness, monthly payroll.

**Core tension:** more loans = more revenue, but overloading people tanks happiness → mistakes, slower stages, and eventually resignations. The Employees screen is where the player keeps the machine humane.

---

## 6. Random Events

Events fire during the day and land in the notification feed (Dashboard, right panel) with category filters `All / Loans / Customers / Alerts`, and are recapped on the End-of-Day screen.

**Positive (examples from mockups + thread):**
- Customer uploads documents early
- Customer writes a glowing review (+reputation)
- Referral arrives from a happy customer (new lead, high starting trust)
- New lead discovered in an unowned neighborhood (expansion teaser)
- Interest rates improve (more leads arrive)
- Deal streak — multiple closings in one hour (badge trigger)

**Negative:**
- Missing document discovered late in Review (loan bounces back to Documents)
- Customer changes jobs (Proof of Job must be re-collected)
- Appraisal/inspection delayed (Closing pushed)
- Customer makes a big purchase before closing (approval at risk — teaches a real lesson gently)
- Employee is starting to feel burned out (workload warning)
- Office internet outage (all stages slowed for N hours)
- Impatient customer threatens to walk (respond via Contact or lose the loan)

**Design rule:** every negative event must have a clear player response (an action button or an obvious next step). Events never silently ruin a run.

---

## 7. Upgrades

Five categories × five tiers = **25 upgrades**, displayed as left-to-right progression trees with three states: **Purchased** (check), **Available** (cost shown), **Locked** (lock icon; previous tier required). Header shows total progress ("11 / 25").

| Category | Theme line | Tier 1 → 5 (mockup names & coin costs) |
|---|---|---|
| Office Improvements | "Make your workspace cozy" | Cozy Chairs → Better Lighting → Coffee Machine (1,200) → Corner Office (3,500) → Executive Suite (12,000) |
| Staff Training | "Level up your team" | Basic Skills → Advanced Training → Leadership → Specialization (2,400) → Master Class (6,800) |
| Marketing | "Attract new customers" | Flyers → Local Ads (1,600) → Social Media (2,200) → TV Spots (5,400) → Brand Voice (9,000) |
| Technology | "Modernize the office" | Modern PCs → Fast Internet → CRM System (3,200) → AI Assistant (7,500) → Auto Approvals (14,000) |
| Customer Experience | "Delight your clients" | Welcome Kit → Coffee Bar (1,800) → Concierge (4,200) → Priority Line (6,500) → VIP Lounge (11,000) |

**Upgrade detail popover:** icon, name, `Category · Tier N`, one-line flavor description, 2–3 quantified benefit chips (e.g. `+15% new leads`, `+8% reputation`, `+5% happiness`), and a purchase button with cost.

**Effect mapping (what each category buffs):**
- Office → employee happiness & productivity
- Staff Training → skill growth rate & skill caps
- Marketing → lead volume & reputation
- Technology → stage processing speed & error reduction
- Customer Experience → customer happiness & trust gain

---

## 8. Economy

**Three currencies (as designed on the Upgrades screen header):**

| Currency | Earned by | Spent on |
|---|---|---|
| **Coins ($)** | Closing loans, monthly servicing trickle | Salaries, hiring, most upgrades, branch offices, training |
| **Gems** | Achievements/badges, 5-star days, milestone rewards | Premium/cosmetic upgrades, instant-finish a stage, rare candidates. *Earned in play only — no real-money purchases, ever.* |
| **Research** | Completing loans of new types, tutorial steps, "first time" discoveries | Technology-tier unlocks and specializations |

**Income:**
- Loan closing fee: % of loan amount (tunable; target ~1.5–2% so a $340K loan pays ~$5–7K)
- Monthly payment trickle from serviced loans (e.g. the "Payment Received · Johnson · $2,340 monthly" notification)
- Referral bonuses, achievement rewards

**Expenses:**
- Monthly payroll (visible on Employees header, e.g. "$42.6K")
- Upgrades, training, hiring costs
- Branch expansion (e.g. Riverside Village branch: **$45,000**)
- Scouting a neighborhood (cheap information purchase before committing)

**Ambient economy:** a global Interest Rate (HUD stat, e.g. 6.4%) drifts over time and shifts lead volume and mix (low rates → refinance wave; high rates → fewer but more serious buyers). This is the game's gentle macro-lesson.

**Reputation (0–100):** a HUD-level stat fed by reviews, completions, and events; gates some expansion and improves lead quality.

---

## 9. World Map & Expansion

**Region:** Meadowbrook Region — 6 neighborhoods at launch:

| Neighborhood | Launch state | Demand | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Old Town | **Main Office** | High | Starting location; businesses + houses |
| Sunny Heights | Branch (unlockable early) | High | First expansion target in mockup state |
| Riverside Village | Available | High | "Cozy riverside community full of first-time buyers." 142 homes, 12 leads, branch cost $45,000 |
| Uptown Hills | Locked | Med | Larger homes, bigger loans |
| East Ridge | Locked | Low | Cheap to enter, slow burn |
| Green Valley | Locked | Med | Largest neighborhood (most houses) |

**Map UI:** left panel lists neighborhoods with status lines ("Main Office · 24 loans", "Available! · 12 leads", "Locked · —"); right detail panel shows description, Demand / Homes / Leads stats, branch cost, **Open Branch Office** button, and a **Send scouts first** secondary action (reveals hidden stats for a small fee). Legend: Main Office / Branch / Available / Locked / High Demand / Customers. Ambient life: people and cars animate on the map.

**Expansion loop:** Reputation + coins unlock neighborhoods → new branch generates local leads → local demand level sets lead rate → each branch needs staff assigned (post-launch: per-branch staffing; at launch, branches share the team pool).

---

## 10. Progression

**Player identity:** The player has a name, avatar, title, and level (Dashboard user card, e.g. "Alex Turner · CEO · Level 4" — name is chosen at New Game; "Alex Turner" is placeholder art).

**Reconciled design decision:** The thread proposed starting as a Loan Officer and earning promotions; the mockups show a CEO at Level 4. These merge as one system — **player level = career title**, and titles gate features:

| Level | Title | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Loan Officer | Tutorial; one desk, one customer at a time; Lead→Application only (rest auto-resolve slowly) |
| 2 | Senior Loan Officer | Hire first Processor; Documents stage becomes playable |
| 3 | Branch Manager | Reviewer + Closer hires; full pipeline; Upgrades screen |
| 4 | CEO | World Map; first branch expansion; Reports |
| 5 | Regional Director | 3+ branches; advanced upgrades (Tier 4–5) |
| 6+ | Mortgage Mogul | Prestige-style long-game goals, seasonal events |

**XP sources:** completed loans, achievements (End-of-Day shows "+300 XP"), tutorial steps, first-time discoveries.

**Achievements/badges (launch set from mockups):** Deal Streak (3 loans in 1 hour), Happy Customer (5-star review), Team Builder (hired new employee), Rainmaker ($50K in a day), Scout (found new lead). Badges award XP and gems; End-of-Day surfaces newly earned badges with a `NEW` ribbon.

**Day rating:** each day is scored 1–5 stars from loans completed, satisfaction, morale, and events — shown on the End-of-Day hero ("Great day! · 4/5 stars").

---

## 11. Screens & UI Flow

**Navigation model:** persistent left sidebar on the Dashboard (`Office, Employees, Pipeline, Upgrades, Reports, Map, Settings` — with live count badges on Employees/Pipeline); sub-screens use a back button + breadcrumb (`Dashboard / Loan Pipeline`).

```
Main Menu ── New Game ──> Tutorial (7 steps, skippable) ──> Office Dashboard
                                                              │
              ┌───────────┬──────────┬────────────┬───────────┼──────────┬──────────┐
              ▼           ▼          ▼            ▼           ▼          ▼          ▼
           Office      Employees   Pipeline    Upgrades    Reports      Map      Settings
                                      │
                                      ▼
                              Loan detail popover ──> Customer Profile (prev/next paging: "Customer 3 of 24")
                                      
Day ends ──> End of Day Summary ──> Start Next Day ──> Dashboard (next day)
```

**Screen inventory (all 10 designed in Pencil):**

1. **Main Menu** — title + tagline, buttons `New Game / Continue / Settings / Credits / Exit`, animated town scene background, keyboard hint ("Press ENTER for New Game").
2. **Office Dashboard** — the hub. Top KPI bar (Money, Reputation /100, Active Loans, Happiness %, Interest %) + day/season chip; sidebar nav; central isometric office scene (workstations, employees, decor items like plants/water cooler that reflect purchased upgrades); notification panel with filter chips and event cards (title, detail, relative timestamp).
3. **Loan Pipeline** — 7-column Kanban, summary metric row, search + filter, loan detail popover.
4. **Customer Profile** — 3-column layout: portrait/traits/happiness/trust · dream home + journey · document checklist; 4-action row; prev/next customer paging.
5. **Employee Management** — team header stats + Hire; role tabs with counts; employee card grid; Train/Promote/Assign Work.
6. **Upgrades** — currency header (coins/gems/research), legend + total progress, 5 category rows × 5 nodes, purchase popover.
7. **World Map** — isometric region view, neighborhood list panel, detail/expansion panel, legend, zoom controls.
8. **End of Day Summary** — hero (day chip, verdict, star rating), 4 KPI cards with deltas, hourly revenue bar chart (9a–6p, today vs. yesterday), events highlights, badges earned, Up Next teaser, `Start Next Day` + Save/Share.
9. **Tutorial Overlay** — dimmed background with spotlight, mascot ("Alex says…"), step chip (`STEP 3 OF 7`), title + friendly explanation + tip bullets, Previous/Next/dot nav, persistent Skip Tutorial link, top progress indicator.
10. **Style Guide** — see Section 12.

**Tutorial content (7 steps):** Welcome & office tour → Meet your first customer → The pipeline → The Documents stage ("When a customer sends you their papers… Peek inside to see what's still missing!") → Approving & closing → Hiring your first employee → Your first day ends. Tone: encouraging tips, never walls of text.

## 12. Art & Content Style (binding rules from the Style Guide screen)

**Feel:** Cozy · Warm · Cheerful · Educational.

**Color palette** (never pure black; "colorful but muted — warm sunset primaries with soft accents"):

| Group | Tokens |
|---|---|
| Warm primaries | Sunset `#E9A554` · Cream `#F5EFE0` · Terracotta `#D96658` · Honey `#F5C842` |
| Cool accents | Sky `#5EAAE0` · Sage `#5FA574` · Lavender `#9B7EDB` · Rose `#E86D93` |
| Neutrals | Ink `#2E2417` · Cocoa `#7A6D57` · Sand `#E7DFD0` · Paper `#FFFFFF` |
| Semantic | Success `#5FA574` · Warning `#E9A554` · Danger `#D96658` · Info `#5EAAE0` |

**Typography:** Headings — **Fraunces** (friendly serif, weight 700; scale 44/H1, 28/H2, 20/H3, 16/H4). Body — **Inter** (18/Lead, 14/Body, 11/Caption, 10/Label).

**Voice & tone (hard rule):** "We write like a friendly coworker. Short sentences, no jargon. Say 'papers' instead of 'documents' and 'yes/no' instead of 'approval'. Encouraging, patient, curious. Celebrate small wins. When something goes wrong, offer a next step — never blame the player."

**Components:** rounded panels (radius scale 10 / 14 / 20 / 999 — never sharp corners), soft shadow `0 6px 20 #2E241714`, 1px sand borders, 2px warm focus ring.

**Iconography:** Lucide outline icons in rounded soft-color tiles; rounded friendly strokes, no thin technical lines, never solid black on white.

**Characters:** slightly cartoonish, big eyes, expressive, diverse; 120×140 base size; 5 core expressions (Happy, Excited, Thoughtful, Confused, Sad).

**Buildings:** 30° isometric suburban; bright roofs, warm siding, yellow windows, no sharp edges.

**Motion:** Idle Bob (±2px, 2.4s ease-in-out) · Blink (4s loop, 120ms close) · Confetti Burst on loan close (800ms) · Reaction Pop (scale 1.0→1.15, spring). Confetti-on-close is the game's signature payoff moment and ships in the first playable milestone.

---

## 13. Open Questions & Deferred Decisions

1. **"Northpointe Branch" label** on the Dashboard mockup — placeholder or intentional? Recommendation: make office name player-chosen at New Game; keep it out of shipped art for a public release.
2. **Reports screen** — in the sidebar nav but has no mockup. Deferred to a later milestone; hide the nav item until then.
3. **Per-branch staffing** — launch uses a shared employee pool; per-branch assignment is a post-launch system.
4. **Gems economy tuning** — earn rates need playtest data; the no-real-money rule is final.
5. **Save/Share on End-of-Day** — Save is core; Share (image export of the day card) is nice-to-have.
6. **Audio** — no direction yet. Cozy lo-fi loop + soft UI sounds proposed; needs its own mini style guide.
