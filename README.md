# Mortgage Tycoon

*(Formerly "Mortgage Empire" — save keys keep the old name so long-time players' progress survives.)*

> *Build your neighborhood. Own the block.*

**A Cozy Tycoon Game** — a 2D isometric management game where you guide real, memorable people (not loan numbers) through the journey of buying a home. Grow from a single desk in Old Town into a thriving multi-branch mortgage company across the Meadowbrook Region by keeping customers happy, your team healthy, and your pipeline flowing.

## You start alone

It's *your* mortgage company — so on day one, you're the whole staff. You welcome the leads, request the documents, sign off every page in underwriting, and close the loans yourself, at a founder's humble pace. Every hire automates their part of the journey (the manual buttons never go away): a Loan Officer opens files, a Processor chases paperwork, an Underwriter reviews documents one per hour, a Closer lands the keys. Later come the supporting cast — IT Support (level 5) to keep the Wi-Fi gremlins away, a Loan Officer Assistant (level 8) to mail your thank-you notes, and a Compliance Officer (level 15) you'll be very glad to have when the level-20 audit knocks.

## The idea

A player who finishes the tutorial and a few days of play should be able to describe the real home-loan journey — using the real terms — because the game taught them gently as they played. Loans move through a nine-stage pipeline that mirrors the real process:

```
Lead → Pre-Qualification → Application → Document Collection → Processing
     → Underwriting → Clear to Close → Closing → Complete 🏠
```

Real-world sub-steps (Loan Estimate, Appraisal, Title Review, Conditional Approval, Closing Disclosure, Funding) happen *inside* those stages as status tags and feed events — clarity, not realism overload. Every mortgage term in the UI is **bold with a ⓘ**: hover or tap for a friendly definition, why it matters, and where it sits in the journey. The **Mortgage Learning Center** collects all glossary entries with progressive "Learned" tracking.

## Design pillars

1. **People, not paperwork.** Every loan is a character with a face, traits, and a dream home.
2. **Real terms, gently taught.** Authentic mortgage terminology (Underwriting, Loan Estimate, Closing Disclosure), every term glossary-linked with a one-tap plain-language explanation.
3. **Cozy, never punishing.** Setbacks create gentle pressure and choices — no failure screens, no hard game over.
4. **Simplified but truthful.** The loan journey is close enough to the real process to be genuinely educational — without regulatory complexity or term overload.

## Core systems

- **Pipeline** — a 9-column Kanban board of active loans across six loan products (Conventional, FHA, VA at the start; Jumbo, Construction, and USDA unlock as your career climbs) and two purposes (Purchase, Refinance), each with its own amounts, pace, and customer temperament. The early conversations move at the click of a button; from Processing onward the real waiting periods bind — including a per-document sign-off in Underwriting.
- **Glossary & Learning Center** — 33 beginner-friendly entries across Getting Started, Documents, Loan Process, and Financial Concepts; terms unlock as they appear in play, reading one earns XP, and every fifth level brings a pop quiz.
- **Customers** — a hand-drawn cast of borrowers with personality traits, a happiness meter, and a slower-moving trust level. Trusting customers send paperwork faster; nagged ones wear thin; a stressed or forgetful one sends the wrong papers; a truly neglected one walks away. Names and stories never repeat within a save.
- **Employees** — you start with none. Seven hireable roles (Loan Officer, Loan Officer Assistant, Processor, Underwriter, Closer, IT Support, Compliance Officer). Their pace is never a fixed number: skill, happiness, seniority, and workload all move it, and letting someone go shakes everyone who stays — the core tension.
- **The Wall of Homes** — every family you help gets a scrapbook page: their photo in front of their new home and the note they left on closing day. Send a thank-you note back (one per family) and word of mouth brings a brand-new referral lead.
- **Office mishaps** — from day 6, some mornings misbehave: Wi-Fi outages, printer jams, surprise system updates, a broken coffee machine. In-house IT makes them rarer, shorter, and gentler on morale.
- **Upgrades** — 25 upgrades across five categories (Office, Staff Training, Marketing, Technology, Customer Experience). Office tiers visibly renovate the room, desks and all.
- **Economy** — coins from closings and servicing, gems earned in play only (**no real-money purchases, ever**), research for tech unlocks, plus a drifting global interest rate that shifts lead volume and mix. When rates hit a low, the morning news announces a refi boom and shoppers pour in; when they spike, the door goes quiet for a few days.
- **World map** — six neighborhoods in the Meadowbrook Region to scout, unlock, and open branches in.
- **Progression** — thirty career levels, from Loan Officer to Mortgage Mogul, gating features as the game opens up. Mastery invites adversity: from level 10 underwriting can bounce a file back, and level 20 brings a compliance audit. Day ratings, XP, badges, and an end-of-day summary close each loop.

## Look & voice

Cozy, warm, cheerful, educational. Warm sunset primaries with soft accents, never pure black, never sharp corners — plus a **Cozy Dark** theme in Settings. Headings in Fraunces, body in Inter. All the art is hand-made for the game: the isometric office (which grows through three stages as you upgrade), a cast of sixteen office faces, seventeen borrower households with their matching houses, and the Meadowbrook Region map — set to a lo-fi soundtrack. Confetti bursts when a loan closes — the game's signature payoff moment.

The writing rule: *"We write like a friendly coworker who happens to know mortgages. Short sentences. Use the real term — then make it feel easy. Celebrate small wins. When something goes wrong, offer a next step — never blame the player."*

## Architecture (v1)

The simulation is a **pure TypeScript engine with zero React imports** — the UI renders state and dispatches actions, never computes game logic. Time advances in one-hour ticks (9 AM–6 PM, 10 ticks per day), all randomness flows through a seeded RNG so every day is reproducible and unit-testable, and every tunable number lives in one constants file.

No game engine in v1: most screens are pure UI, and the scene screens (office, world map) render the hand-made isometric art with gentle motion — plain img/CSS handles them. Phaser is deferred until a feature genuinely needs it.

Saves autosave to `localStorage` with JSON export/import and a full migration chain (v1 → v11), so old saves keep working as the game grows. The app deploys as a static build to GitHub Pages. A replayable 14-step guided tour (the ? button) spotlights each part of the dashboard as it teaches.

Development proceeded in milestones (M0 scaffold → M8 world map/tutorial/polish → M9 Solo Founder), each ending in a working, committed build — see the [technical design document](docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md) §8.
